Geomap image

Docs:
- To get locations with images, currently must manually enable via camera app > settings > location with photos or similar option
- Must use image sharable weblink (hosted via accessible server like Google Photos or OneDrive)

DOP Value Rating Description 1 Ideal Highest possible confidence level to be used for applications demanding the highest possible precision at all times. 
- 1-2 Excellent At this confidence level, positional measurements are considered accurate enough to meet all but the most sensitive applications. 
- 2-5 Good Represents a level that marks the minimum appropriate for making accurate decisions. Positional measurements could be used to make reliable in-route navigation suggestions to the user. 
- 5-10 Moderate Positional measurements could be used for calculations, but the fix quality could still be improved. A more open view of the sky is recommended. 
- 10-20 Fair Represents a low confidence level. Positional measurements should be discarded or used only to indicate a very rough estimate of the current location.
- >20 Poor At this level, measurements are inaccurate by as much as 300 meters with a 6-meter accurate device (50 DOP Ã— 6 meters) and should be discarded.
